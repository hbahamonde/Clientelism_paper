    Do parties target individuals or groups? This is a question fundamental
    to understanding clientelism, yet the literature does not offer an
    answer. This paper argues that depending on certain conditions, brokers
    target individuals when they are identifiable and groups when brokers
    need to rely on the spillover effects of clientelism. Both
    identifiability and spillovers depend on individual poverty, group
    poverty and political competition. Though the theory I outline focuses
    on targeting, the paper also argues that structural factors, such as the
    density of the poor, should be considered in the vote-buying literature.
    Structural factors are one of the few observables upon which brokers can
    base their decision regarding where to invest in clientelism. Using
    survey data from Brazil, the paper exploits variations in personal
    incomes within contexts of differing levels of poverty. I find that
    political parties engage in segmented or ad-hoc strategies, targeting
    individuals when identifiability is high, and groups when there are
    economies of scale. Importantly, non-poor individuals can also be
    offered clientelism.

There is no agreement on when, how and why parties choose to aim
clientelistic practices at individuals or groups. The distributive
politics and vote-buying literatures have traditionally pursued one of
two approaches. On the one hand, the former has mostly focused on group
targeting, usually districts or provinces.[^2] In this literature,
incumbent parties deliver public-sector jobs or construction projects
contingent on the support of *groups* of people. On the other hand, the
latter has typically focused on *individuals* and their characteristics,
such as their socio-economic or electoral profiles. However, it is not
clear when clientelistic brokers use one or the other strategy, and why.
Moreover, the decision to investigate group-based and/or
individual-based targeting seems to be attributable to distinct research
designs and agendas, rather than theory. For example, ethnographers most
generally focus on individuals, while others have traditionally focused
on groups.[^3] What is most concerning, however, is that it is
relatively assumed or implied that individual and group clientelistic
targeting strategies are interchangeable, when they are clearly not.
Groups and individuals have different reasons and mechanisms to defect
or cooperate and vote for the incumbent. They also face different costs
and coordination dilemmas. In this paper I systematize the process of
deciding who to target by arguing it is a function of three mechanisms:
individuals’ discount factors explained by income levels, the incentives
of clientelistic brokers to rely on spillover effects caused by the
nesting structure of individuals (i.e. whether individuals are nested in
poor or non-poor contexts), and brokers’ incentives to engage in
clientelism explained by higher electoral pressures and political
competition. Given the nested structure of the argument and the
empirics, I am able to disentangle the effects of “being poor” and
“living in a poor area” on clientelistic targeting. I share @Carlin2015
[14]’s diagnosis, in that “\[e\]xisting research looks almost
*exclusively* at individuals’ socio-economic and, specially, electoral
profile \[and\] \[y\]et our knowledge of who parties target remains
incomplete.”[^4] The paper seeks to contribute to the vote-buying
literature by incorporating structural factors and individual factors of
clientelism in the same theory. Another important implication of the
argument is that I am able to explain why clientelistic parties target
their resources to both poor *and* non-poor individuals, an empirical
regularity that to the best of my knowledge has been unexplored so far
(see ).

Perhaps the area in which there is the most agreement among scholars is
on the relationship between poverty and vote-buying.[^5] For example,
@Brusco2004, @Stokes:2013cj and @Nazareno2008a explain that since the
poor derive more utility from immediate transfers than the risky returns
associated with future policy packages, clientelistic political parties
*only* target the poor. In fact, @Weitz-Shapiro:2014aa [12] explains
that “\[a\]lmost *universally*, scholars of clientelism treat and
analyze \[this\] practice as an exchange between politicians and their
poor clients.”[^6] However, this canonical predictor has recently been
challenged. @Szwarcberg2013 “challenges the assumption \[that brokers\]
with access to material benefits will always distribute goods to
low-income voters in exchange for electoral support,” while
@Gonzalez-Ocantos2012 and @Holland2015 found that income (measured at
the individual level) had little or no effect on vote-buying. In fact,
the Brazilian case, in , also shows that non-poor individuals do receive
clientelistic offerings. *Why would brokers target non-poor
individuals?* And relatedly, *Why is contemporary scholarly work
reporting null findings for poverty, traditionally the most important
predictor of vote-buying?* I present an argument where individual income
*on its own* is not relevant. What matters is how *noticeable*
individuals are. For example, wealthier individuals living in poorer
contexts are very identifiable. In low-information environments, brokers
use these observables to reduce their costs.

One often-considered contextual factor in the literature is the size of
the community where clientelism takes place. Large-sized communities
impose principal-agent problems. If an individual’s vote is bought, he
or she may be tempted to accept the benefit and then vote for his or her
preferred candidate anyway, and this incentive increases linearly with
the size of the community where the individual is nested. Several
scholars have then argued that brokers prefer smaller groups because
individuals nested in small communities should defect less.[^7] One
problem, however, is that it is not clear how political parties gain
enough electoral returns from such an expensive strategy. Vote-buying is
an already expensive strategy,[^8] making one-to-one vote-buying even
more so.[^9] Therefore, the theoretical challenge is that this method
seems to be extremely expensive given the relatively small number of
votes brokers can secure. Moreover, the cost of this strategy increases
linearly with the size of the targeted population. The brokers’
production-possibility frontier cannot be shifted upwards either, i.e.
monitoring capacities are bounded. Simply put, at some point party
machines run out of brokers. It is hard to conceive that brokers will
stop being clientelistic when the size of the population is large,
specially when political competition is high. In my argument, when
brokers need to secure large amounts of electoral support, specially
when political competition is high, they turn to group targeting
strategies relying on the spillover effects of clientelism. In these
contexts, clientelism mobilizes electoral support from *actual* and
*potential* beneficiaries, a mechanism that I explain later on in the
paper.

Civic associations might help solve some of the challenges large-sized
groups present to brokers. As low-information environments prevent
brokers from really observing individual electoral behavior,[^10] they
usually resort to alternative methods that allow them to make safer
inferences. For example, @Schaffer2015 explain that clientelism is
“socially multiplied” as party machines target individuals “who are
opinion-leading epicenters” in informal situations or “partisan
networks,”[^11] in what has been called “organization buying.”[^12] And
if parties buy “turnout,”[^13] then they will most probably target
associations too, as “citizens immersed in clientelistic networks
\[...\] have a higher probability of voting than the rest.”[^14] The
positive relationship between group-membership and clientelism is
intuitive. However, what has not been explored yet is whether
clientelism is explained by association membership itself, or by the
fact that poor individuals usually address their problems as an
organized community since otherwise it would be too costly to solve them
outside of the group. If this is the case, group *membership* should be
spuriously related to clientelism. While I find that group membership
does have a positive effect on clientelism, I find that the density of
the poor in a given area has even more explanatory power.

In an important paper, @Weitz-shapiro finds that in several Argentine
municipalities, higher levels of political competition mixed and low
socioeconomic indicators led to more clientelism. In her paper losses
are conceptualized in terms of “moral costs.”[^15] Evidence for these
types of costs have been presented in the literature very recently. For
example, @Carlin2015 argue that citizens endowed with more democratic
values feel more “moral repugnance” to clientelism, @Vicente2014
explains that vote-buying practices have an “immoral/illegal
connotation,” and @Gonzalez-Ocantos2012 find that individuals wanting to
avoid social stigma usually do not give truthful answers when asked
directly about clientelism. However, it is not clear if individuals who
benefit from vote-buying really *understand* these kinds of ‘costs.’ In
fact, @GonzalezOcantos2014 find that while the concrete benefits
obtained through vote-buying are generally well understood, “the
abstract societal costs of such exchanges are often distant from the
every-day world in which clientelistic relationships are formed.”
Individuals then might not really understand that clientelism is bad for
democracy, or something to be ashamed of. Also, individuals with
democratic values are also the ones with higher incomes, precisely the
ones that are not supposed to receive clientelistic offerings. Finally,
given that clientelism usually satisfies immediate material needs,
clientelism might very well counterweight any other cost, moral or
otherwise. In other words, clientelism might be worth the ‘shame’ or
‘repugnance.’ I argue that political competition rises the incentives to
capture more votes in a way that is affordable for brokers. When
political competition is high, clientelism will be higher in contexts
where poor individuals live in poor economic contests, suggesting that
brokers rely on the economies of scale and spillover effects clientelism
provides.

When do parties target individuals and when groups?\[argument\] {#when-do-parties-target-individuals-and-when-groupsargument .unnumbered}
===============================================================

I argue that brokers will have incentives to engage in individual
targeting when targets are easier to *identify*. Identifiability not
only helps brokers to keep targeted individuals electorally accountable,
but also to reduce the net costs of clientelism. Whereas individual
targeting is the safest bet a broker can make, it also the most
expensive one as it requires brokers to have sustained close
relationships with clients. In the framework I propose the capacity
brokers have to identify potential clients does not necessarily come
from third-party sources (associations), but from a few observables
brokers have at their disposition. In this paper I focus on how
*noticeable* individuals are in their respective contexts. Should
brokers engage in individual targeting, they would rather visit highly
noticeable *poor* households in largely *non*-poor neighborhoods. As
these households stand out in these contexts, it is easy for brokers to
notice whether they need construction materials, whether there are wakes
to which they could contribute flowers or birthday parties to which they
could bring cakes. Poor households need not be close to each other, they
just need to be *visible* enough for brokers to detect their needs.
Income alone does not play an independent role. What is important is how
individual incomes interact with their respective poverty context,
making individuals more or less identifiable. Individuals will be more
noticeable when non-poor individuals are nested in poor areas (quadrant
1) and when poor individuals are nested in non-poor areas (quadrant 4)
in .

When poor individuals are nested in poor areas, or vice-versa,
individual targeting is no longer efficient. Since individuals are
masked by their environments, identifiability is hard to achieve,
increasing the cost of this strategy. In these circumstances, depicted
in quadrants 2 and 3 in , group targeting is more efficient as it relies
on the *spillover* effects provided by larger concentrations of
individuals. Group targeting works because it also mobilizes electoral
support from *potential* clients, that is, those who have not received
benefits yet. @Auyero2000 [65] describes the case of *Alfonsina* in
Argentina. *Alfonsina* was part of the brokers’ inner circle and
received a job as a cleaning lady in a public school. As the broker
explained to her before getting the job, *Alfonsina* had to be *patient*
because as a member of ‘the circle,’ she was in the pool of potential
beneficiaries; it was only a “matter of time” until she could get the
job. Building on this intuition, my argument presents two ideal types:
*actual* and *potential* beneficiaries. The former receive
particularistic benefits “today” and vote for the broker’s candidate
“tomorrow,” while the latter do not receive benefits today (in the
expectation of receiving them in the future) but *still* vote for the
broker’s candidate. Actual beneficiaries want to remain actual
beneficiaries; thus, they keep supporting the broker’s candidate.
Potential beneficiaries want to become actual beneficiaries, but are
uncertain when that might happen; as a result, they keep supporting the
broker’s candidate. This mechanism requires the broker’s ability to not
allow the transaction costs of switching strategies to be lower than
what it costs clients to wait to be benefited. In other words, brokers
need to take care of their reputation and deliver benefits.
@Zarazaga2014 [14] finds that *brokers and voters’ interests are
aligned. Since the flow of resources to voters is dependent on their
brokers’ electoral success, if the broker loses the election and is
replaced, clients do not know what/if the new broker will get them
benefits. A new broker may access to fewer resources or choose to
distribute them to other people, and brokers often remind voters about
this*. Hence, no matter what the type is, both of them keep voting for
the broker’s party. Given that the poor are risk-averse, potential
beneficiaries are better-off waiting (and voting for the broker’s party)
than defecting. In the same vein but in a slightly different subject,
@Magaloni:2008bq [20] explains that in non-democratic contexts voters
have incentives to keep voting for the incumbent government, *even when
they oppose it*.[^16] Hence, the cost of switching brokers (or
defecting) is very high since it also involves building from scratch
relationships of confidence with the new broker. Also reputation costs
keep clients disciplined, and brokers exploit these self-enforced
compliance dynamics. Vote-buying is also targeted to non-poor groups
individuals nested in poor groups, as in quadrant 3. Though vote-buying
has decreasing returns to scale in non-poor individuals,[^17] low levels
of political contestation give local politicians more “room to move,”
allowing them to divert local resources into more expensive means of
targeting (embezzlement). This situation is sustained by the very low
levels of political opposition.

Case Selection, Research Design and Data Analyses {#case-selection-research-design-and-data-analyses .unnumbered}
=================================================

This paper tests the effects of individual income, the effects of being
nested in *communities* with different poverty structures (a variable
which I call `density of the poor`), and the effect of being exposed to
different levels of political competition, on receiving clientelism.
Brazil is a good case because its poverty structure is such that it is
possible to find low-income individuals nested in non-poor areas (and
vice versa). This case is also interesting from an institutional
perspective. The Brazilian electoral system *incentivizes* clientelism.
Several factors such as multimember districts with open lists and the
institution of the *candidato nato*,[^18] “clearly \[makes\] Brazil one
of the most personalistic systems of democratic governance.”[^19] In
fact, @Gingerich2014b [290] finds that vote-buying drastically changed
electoral results, concluding that “\[v\]ote brokerage can still pay
electoral dividends in contemporary Brazil.”

To test this hypothesis, I use survey data from 2010 from
@LAPOP2010.[^20] Though the LAPOP survey provides a question for income,
people who are somewhat better off than their neighbors but live in poor
areas may not “feel” poor. If this is the case, this could confound the
results. Additionally, when answering the questioner, individuals might
not want to reveal their true incomes (either because it is too low or
too high). Following the advice of @Cordova2008 and @Cordova2009
[@Cordova2010], a relative wealth index (RWI) was constructed.[^21]
Using principal component analyses, the index measures wealth based on
actual assets weighted by how common these assets are. Different indexes
were constructed for urban and rural contexts. plots the distribution of
the combined index separated by clientelism. To measure the density of
the poor, I followed a strategy similar to that of @Weitz-shapiro,
measuring the degree of poverty at the municipal level. Using
information from the 2010 Brazilian census,[^22] a variable was
constructed that measures the percentage of individuals who live on less
than half of the minimum wage in a given municipality
(`density of the poor`). Given that the municipality of residence for
each individual in the LAPOP survey is recorded, I was able to merge the
census percentage with the LAPOP dataset. The `density of the poor`
serves as a good proxy to capture the size of the poor group. It is
important to stress that the unit of analysis is the individual, and
that this variable captures the economic context in which each
individual lives. And just like other scholars in the past have tested
the effect of being nested in rural areas,[^23] this paper focuses on
another class of contextual variable. Although the `density of the poor`
group was originally a semi-continuous variable,[^24] it had to be
dichotomized at the median (29%) to be able to construct a matched
sample, which I justify and explain below. shows the continuous
distribution dichotomized at the median (dashed line). Finally, to
measure political competition, the paper follows @Weitz-shapiro. Using
official electoral data from the 2008 municipal elections,[^25] a
variable was constructed that measures the percentage of seats that are
not controlled by the mayor’s party in a given municipal council.

There is a built-in lack of relationship between “being poor” and
“living in a poor municipality,” confirming that Brazil is in fact a
good case to test this theory. in the Appendix shows that the
unmatched/raw dataset had already embedded low levels of correlation
between these two variables (0.44).[^26] Using matching methods, I am
able to further break this relationship. Matching is a two-stage
process. In the first stage the analysts preprocesses the data, seeking
to break any systematic relationship between, in this case, the
`density of the poor` and the wealth index (RWI).[^27] Matching does so
by deleting observations for which matches cannot be found.[^28] The
idea is to obtain a good covariate balance as in (in the Online
Appendix), to then estimate any appropriated statistical model.[^29]
From a statistical standpoint, preprocessed datasets are less
model-dependent[^30] and prevent analysts from making extreme
counterfactuals.[^31] and in the Appendix provide summary statistics for
both the matched and raw datasets.[^32] The preprocessed data used in
the matching approach has 54 municipalities while the raw data used in
the generalized propensity score (GPS) approach (which I explain below)
has 54 too. lists the municipalities and shows which ones are considered
“high” or “low” in terms of the `density of the poor` after the
dichotomization process. The figure also shows that there exists
considerable variance in income/RWI in both high and low poverty density
conditions (bubbles).[^33]

It could be argued that dichotomizing the `density of the poor` variable
at the median is an arbitrary decision. While there have been
theoretical advances regarding general treatment effects regimes for
continuous or semi-continuous response doses,[^34] algorithms with the
ability to match on continuous treatment variables are not common. In
order to obtain covariate balance in a non-parametric way (as matching
does) but *without* dichotomizing the `density of the poor`, I also use
the original (i.e. *continuous*) `density of the poor` variable to
construct a generalized propensity score (GPS).[^35] The score is used
to *weight* each observation in the model. Besides matching on and
weighting by income, I also included the following variables to match
on/weighting by: municipal opposition, municipal population and
individual involvement in civic associations.

The dependent variable is clientelism. To measure it, I use the question
that asks if *a candidate or someone from a political party offered
\[the respondent\] something, like a favor, food, or any other benefit
or thing in return for \[her/his\] vote or support*. Subjects could
answer that this had happened *often*, *sometimes* or *never*.
@Carreras2013a and @Holland2015 use the same dataset and outcome
variable. As they explain, the question did not ask whether respondents
*took* the offer, hence it should not be an important source of social
desirability bias. For statistical and substantive reasons, I
dichotomized this variable, combining the alternatives *often* (n = 91)
and *sometimes* (n = 150), leaving *never* (n = 1196) unchanged.[^36]

The following control variables were considered.
`Perception of corruption` was included to hold constant the effect of
respondents who declared clientelistic activity when in reality they
were referring to corruption scandals.[^37] Brokers usually target civic
associations. Following @Holland2015 [28], who use the same
dataset/year, an additive index to measure civic participation
(`Political Involvement`) was created.[^38] Some have also found group
size to be important. Using the census data, a variable to measure
`population size` at the municipal level was included. I also included
an `urban/rural` dummy. A variable to capture party identification
(`Political Id.`) was included. Higher levels of democratic support
should be negatively associated with clientelism. To control for that, a
variable measuring `democratic support` was included.
@GonzalezOcantos2014 find that schooling plays a negative role on
clientelism; hence, I control for `education` too.

Observations are clustered on a number of important factors such as
levels of municipal political competition, municipal poverty and
municipal population size. In order to account for these clustering
effects, I use a generalized estimating equations approach. GEE were
introduced by @Liang1986 to fit clustered, repeated (i.e. correlated)
and panel data. This method is especially efficient when the data are
binary.[^39] GEE models are similar to random effects models[^40] in
that they allow observations to be nested in hierarchical structures.
This method requires analysts to parameterize the working correlation
matrix. Though @Hedeker2006 [139] explain that “the GEE is robust to
misspecification of the correlation structure,”[^41] @Hardin2013 [166]
point out that “\[i\]f the observations are clustered (not collected
over time), then \[...\] the exchangeable correlation structure” is the
most appropriate working correlation matrix. Given that the data do not
follow a panel but rather a clustered structure, the exchangeable
correlation matrix was specified in all models.

While this method is very flexible, GEE estimates remain uninterpretable
in practice,[^42] making regression tables useless from a substantive
standpoint. In this case, the problem is even more severe due to the
interactive hypotheses being tested in this paper. The main hypothesis
is tested by fitting a parameter for the multiplicative term between the
variables `wealth index`, `political competition` and `high density`.
Methodologists agree on “not interpret\[ing\] the coefficients on the
constitutive terms,” as they lack substantive meaning.[^43] These
problems get more complex when it comes to generalized models as a
series of challenges arise. As @Ai2003 explain, *(1) the interaction
effect could be nonzero, even when the estimation says it is zero, (2)
the statistical significance of the interaction effect cannot be tested
with a simple t-test on the coefficient of the interaction term, (3) the
interaction effect is conditional on the independent variables, \[...\]
and (4) the interaction effect may have different signs for different
values of covariates*. @Brambor2005 [74] offer the same advice, namely
“one cannot determine whether a model should include an interaction term
simply by looking at the significance of the coefficient on the
interaction term.” Given that cross-partial derivatives are not
advisable either, simulation methods are required.[^44] Particularly, I
follow the simulation approach introduced in @King2000. This procedure
samples via simulation from the point estimates, generating a new and
larger distribution. That is, taking the single estimated parameters
(the regression coefficients), I construct a distribution of estimated
values for each coefficient. Relying on the central limit theorem, with
enough sampling draws, the new simulated distribution is a
transformation that approximates with a great degree of precision the
(uninterpretable) coefficients. Subsequently, means and uncertainty
measures can be constructed for each of these distributions. From a
substantive standpoint, simulation methods also allow for sampling new
distributions at different values of the independent variables. This
will be important in simulating the expected value of clientelism for
different “profiles,” such as *non*-poor individuals nested in
*high*-poor dense municipalities in contexts of *high* political
competition, etc.

Since it is “impossible to evaluate conditional hypotheses using only
the information provided in traditional results tables,”[^45] I focus
instead on the substantive results from the simulation methods. However,
I still present the raw results in in the Appendix.[^46] Analogous to ,
in I simulate the predicted probabilities of being targeted using both
the matched and weighted/GPS models. The horizontal panel depicts
simulations for the upper (“non-poor,” 75%) and lower (“poor,” 25%)
quartiles of the continuous `wealth index` variable. In turn, the
vertical panel shows the simulated values for the maximum (100%) and
minimum (43%) values of the `municipal opposition` index. Each quadrant
shows simulations for individuals nested in poor municipalities (*high*
`density of the poor`) and non-poor municipalities (*low*
`density of the poor`). Each profile shows two simulated probability
distributions (with 95% confidence intervals), one for the matched
sample and one for the weighted/GPS model.[^47]

suggests that brokers engage in *individual* targeting when individuals
are identifiable. That is, when individuals are poor *but* nested in
low-poor density municipalities (quadrant 4, with a probability of being
targeted 22%)[^48] and when individuals are not poor but nested in
high-poor density municipalities (quadrant 1, with a probability of
being targeted 24%). This suggests that political competition
incentivizes motivated brokers to engage in vote-buying regardless of
personal income when political competition is high. *Group* targeting is
more efficient in quadrant 2, supporting the spillover effects
hypothesis. When municipal mayors are politically challenged, brokers
target *groups* of poor individuals in poor municipalities (quadrant 2,
25%). I argue that brokers take advantage of the spillover effects of
clientelism based on the incentives both *potential* and *actual*
beneficiaries have to support the broker’s candidate. Non-poor
individuals nested in low-poor density municipalities but exposed to
lower levels of political competition (quadrant 3) are still offered
some vote-buying. In these contexts there are less political competition
and less checks and balances, having incumbents more “room to move.” I
argue that even when politicians are not in need of more electoral
support, they still engage in this expensive form of vote-buying which
is sustained by lowly challenged electoral actors.

shows a plot divided in two panels. Panel <span>**a**</span> shows the
simulated expected probabilities (with 95% confidence intervals) of
being targeted at different levels of political involvement. As the blue
lines suggests, individuals who participate in civic associations have
higher probabilities of being targeted. This is in line with findings in
previous research.[^49] However, once I decompose these effects, being
nested in high-poor density areas contributes substantially more to the
model. These differences are statistically significant. Panel
<span>**b**</span> shows the probability (with 95% confidence intervals)
of being targeted at different increments of the size of the population.
In line with the literature, I also see that this relationship is
negative.[^50] However, the effect of being nested in high-poor density
municipalities outperforms the effect of population size, suggesting
spillover effects.

Discussion {#discussion .unnumbered}
----------

Incentives to offer or take clientelistic offerings are not guided by
structure or individual factors only. This paper has suggested that both
are necessary to better understand how clientelism happens. Clearly,
pressures to incur in this expensive and uncertain strategy rise as
political competition rises as well. However, the execution of this
strategy largely differs depending on whether brokers face homogeneous
or heterogeneous groups of individuals. Each one provides a different
cost-and-benefit structure to either defect or cooperate. When poor
individuals live in poor areas, brokers engage in group targeting
relying on the spillover effects of clientelism. Given that the poor are
risk-averse, even the ones who do not receive benefits support the
broker’s candidate, while the ones who did receive benefits, support him
to keep receiving more benefits. In this sense, clientelism propagates
easily when the poor live among the poor. However, in heterogeneous
areas brokers adapt their strategy and execute clientelism in a
different way, relying on how identifiable individuals are.
Identifiability makes receivers more prone to cooperate, rising the
costs of defection. Finally, the paper hopes that the literature
considers that groups and individuals provide different incentives to
both brokers and individuals, and hence, this distinction should be
incorporated to better understand clientelism.

    @Weitz-shapiro and @Gonzalez-Ocantos2012. I thank Ezequiel González
    Ocantos for this suggestion.

[^4]: Emphasis is mine.

[^5]: See @Calvo2004 [@Weitz-shapiro], @Kitschelt2000 and Kitschelt and
    Altamirano in @Carlin:2015 [ch. 10]. Following @Brusco2004 [67], I
    define vote-buying as “the proffering to voters of cash or (more
    commonly) minor consumption goods by political parties, in office or
    in opposition, in exchange for the recipient’s vote.” In the rest of
    this note, I use clientelism and vote-buying interchangeably.

[^6]: Emphasis is mine.

[^7]: See for an overview @Stokes2005 [323], @Brusco2004, @Kitschelt2007
    [10] and @Magaloni:2008bq [67]. @Rueda2016 finds support for this
    hypothesis in Colombia. Similarly, see @Bratton2008a for Nigeria and
    @Gingerich2013 [456] for Brazil.

[^8]: @Zarazaga2014 [35].

[^9]: For example, @Stokes2005 argues that brokers develop skills that
    allow them to infer whether individual clients in small-sized
    communities voted for their party by *looking at them in the eyes*.
    For the Brazilian case, similar ethnographic evidence is suggested
    in @Gay:1993aa [@Gay1998].

[^10]: @Zarazaga2014 [35].

[^11]: @Calvo2012.

[^12]: @Stokes:2013cj [250-251]. @Holland2015 [16] explain that when
    “parties lack their own brokerage networks \[they seek\] to
    capitalize on organizational networks instead.” Similarly,
    @Rueda2014a [13] argues that parties tend to target very specific
    civic associations of “seniors and associations of single mothers,
    organizing trips to recreational centers outside the city where all
    their expenses are covered.” *Paradoxically*, the stronger the civic
    society, i.e. the more organized it is, the more clientelism.

[^13]: @Nichter2008.

[^14]: @Carreras2013 [7].

[^15]: @Weitz-shapiro argues that non-poor individuals are more likely
    to condemn clientelism “due to self-interest or because of *moral*
    concern\[s\]” (emphasis is mine). That being said, ‘self-interest’
    refers to the idea that what is being distributed through
    clientelism is *discounted* from the pool of resources theoretically
    available to be spent on policy packages. And that *is* an economic
    cost.

[^16]: The Mexican PRI lasted as long as it did not because of electoral
    fraud but because voters supported the “known devil.” As Magaloni
    explains, hegemonic parties survive when they are able to sustain
    long-term economic growth and a constant supply of clientelistic
    transfers.

[^17]: Buying votes from non-poor individuals gets more expensive as
    income increases.

[^18]: “\[R\]ule that removed parties’ control over the nominations
    process and let an electoral legislator decide to run on any party
    ticket.” See @Carlin:2015 [<span>Chapter?</span>].

[^19]: @Carlin:2015 [<span>Chapter?</span>].

[^20]: “I thank the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) and
    its major supporters (the United States Agency for International
    Development, the United Nations Development Program, the
    Inter-American Development Bank, and Vanderbilt University) for
    making the data available.” The sample consists of five strata
    representing the five main geographical regions of Brazil. Each
    stratum was further sub-stratified by urban and rural areas.

[^21]: See also @Santos2016.

[^22]: Official data comes from the Bureau of Statistics of Brazil
    [IBGE](http://www.ibge.gov.br).

[^23]: See for example @Brusco2004 and @Stokes2005. Both of them use the
    log of population, which is a proxy for urban/rural.

[^24]: I.e., a percentage.

[^25]: Data from the [*Tribunal Superior
    Eleitoral*](http://agencia.tse.jus.br/estatistica/sead/odsele/votacao_candidato_munzona/votacao_candidato_munzona_2008.zip).

[^26]: The figure shows that for both the matched and raw datasets,
    “being poor” and “living in a poor municipality” are not confounded,
    as it is possible to find poor individuals living in non-poor areas,
    and viceversa.

[^27]: @King2011

[^28]: The final procedure matched 761 individuals living in the
    low-density poverty condition with 676 individuals living in the
    high-density poverty condition.

[^29]: The idea is that the propensity of being exposed to the “high”
    *density of the poor* condition (the ‘propensity score’) has a
    similar distribution in both ‘treated’ and ‘control’ groups. It is
    important to say that, despite the language, I do not claim any
    causal relationship in this paper.

[^30]: See @Ho2006.

[^31]: @King2005a. The matching routine used was the `full` matching
    routine (see @Hansen2004 and @Rosenbaum:2010ul), via the `MatchIt R`
    package (see @King2011).

[^32]: Tables generated using the `stargazer R` package
    (@Hlavac:2015qf).

[^33]: in the Online Appendix shows the frequency of individuals by
    municipality in both raw and matched datasets.

[^34]: See @Ratkovic2012 and @Hirano2004.

[^35]: See @Imbens2004, @Guardabascio2014 and @Imai2014b. To generate
    the weighting vector, I used the `CBPS R` package (see
    @Fong:2014aa).

[^36]: These numbers come from the matched dataset.

[^37]: I thank Cesar Zucco for this suggestion.

[^38]: This variable was constructed by adding the frequency of
    attendance at religious meetings, community improvement meetings and
    political party meetings (variables `cp6`, `cp8` and `cp13`,
    respectively).

[^39]: @Hanley2003a.

[^40]: @Gardiner2009.

[^41]: @Carlin2001 [402] argue that “\[r\]elatively minor differences in
    estimates may arise depending on how the estimating equations are
    weighted, in particular within the generalized estimating equation
    (GEE) framework.” @Westgate2016 and @Gardiner2009 [227] make the
    same point.

[^42]: @Carlin2001.

[^43]: @Brambor2005 [77].

[^44]: @WilliamJ.Wales2013.

[^45]: @Brambor2005 [76].

[^46]: Table generated via the `texreg R` package. The first column
    shows the estimates for the matched dataset while the second column
    shows the results for the GPS wighted model. Virtually all
    coefficients have the same size and sign.

[^47]: In the case of the weighted/GPS model which does not use the
    dichotomized variable, I use the continuous version of the size of
    the poor variable, where “low density” represents the lower quartile
    while “high density” the upper quartile.

[^48]: Matched sample.
