% FIX
%Do parties target individuals or groups? This is a fundamental question to understand clientelism, and yet the literature does not offer a consensus. This paper argues that brokers target high-dense poverty clusters when political competition is high, and low-dense poverty clusters when political competition is low. Since heavy contestation requires more votes, motivated brokers have the incentives to engage in group-monitoring. Given that brokers cannot increase their monitoring capacities to target large groups, they take their risks and rely on the economies of scale and spillover effects that large aggregations of poor individuals provide. On the contrary, when political contestation is low, brokers target low-dense poverty clusters. This way of targeting is closer to a much secure investment. Building on recent research that gives emphasis to macro variables (group size and electoral competition), it also considers the issue of individual income. However, the paper departs from recent research in that the theory and models presented here do find that clientelism also happens to non-poor individuals only under low-competition settings. In non-contested districts, it is easier to deviate more resources to engage in rather expensive forms of vote-buying. Using Brazil as a case, the paper exploits the variations of personal incomes within different poverty-density contexts to support the theory.

% OK groups vs individuals: hook 1
There is no agreement on when parties target individuals and when parties should target groups. The distributive politics and vote-buying literatures have traditionally followed two different practices. Unfortunately, this decision seems to be grounded on foundations of research design than theoretical reasons. Consequently, it has been implied that the two strategies are interchangeable. On the one hand, the distributive politics literature has mostly focused on groups, usually districts or provinces (\citet[]{Dixit1996}, \citet[]{Khemani2015}, \citet[]{Calvo2004}). In this literature, incumbent parties deliver public-sector jobs or construction projects contingent on the support of \emph{groups} of individuals. On the other hand, the vote-buying literature has typically focused on individuals and their characteristics such as socio-economic or electoral profiles (\citet[]{Carlin2015}). 

% OK income: hook 2
The most consolidated agreement is on the positive effects of poverty on vote-buying (\citet[]{Calvo2004,Weitz-shapiro})\footnote{Vote-buying is ``the proffering to voters of cash or (more commonly) minor consumption goods by political parties, in office or in opposition, in exchange for the recipient's vote'' (\citet[p. 67]{Brusco2004}). In the rest of this note, we use clientelism and vote-buying interchangeable.}. \citet{Kitschelt2000}\footnote{See also Kitschelt and Altamirano in \citet[ch. 10]{Carlin:2015}.}, For example, \citet{Brusco2004}, \citet[]{Stokes:2013cj} and \citet[]{Nazareno2008a} explain that since the poor derive more utility from immediate transfers than future and risky returns associated to policy packages, clientelistic political parties target the poor \emph{only}. This canonical predictor has been recently challenged, however. \citet{Szwarcberg2013} ``challenges the assumption [brokers] with access to material benefits will always distribute goods to low-income voters in exchange for electoral support'', while \citet{GonzalezOcantos:2012vr} and \citet[]{Holland2015} explain that income (measured at the individual level) has little or no effect on vote-buying. Why do newer scholarly work report null fundings on poverty, the \emph{most} important predictor of vote-buying? 

% OK questions
The lack of clarity on whether parties should target groups or/and individuals and when (if) they should switch or combine strategies, leave us in big confusion. \citet[]{Zarazaga2015a} argues that brokers do not offer a uniform reward to all voters. We generalize this idea and argue that depending on the incentive structure, brokers target groups or individuals. Part of this incentive is shaped by individual wealth. However, an important gap in the literature is that it is not explicit on whether ``the poor'' constitute poor \emph{groups} or poor \emph{individuals} (or both). There has not been an explicit effort to theorize about the different set of incentives these two targeting strategies present to both parties and individuals (either considered on their own or nested in groups). For example, \citet[10]{Kitschelt2007} argue that political parties target ``individuals \emph{or} identifiable small groups''\footnote{Emphasis added.}. However, it is not clear what makes parties to focus on one or the other, or both at the same time, why and how. This paper tries to shed light on those issues.

% OK ARGUMENT and // Summary of the paper: LIT REVIEW // METHODS (0)
We argue that the decision brokers face on whether to target groups or individuals is context specific. The paper systematizes this decision by arguing that the outcome is a function of three factors, i.e. individuals' income level, whether individuals are nested within poor or non-poor contexts, and the level of political competition. Given the nesting structure of the argument and the empirics, we are able to provide interesting predictions such as the decomposing the different effects on clientelism of ``being poor'' and ``living in a poor area''. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such comparison is made. Four ideal types are presented, poor individuals nested in (1) poor and (2) non-poor clusters, and non-poor individuals nested in (3) poor and (4) non-poor contexts. In addition to that, depending on how challenged the incumbent party is, brokers take advantage of the different economic incentives each combination has, deploying either individual or group-targeting strategies for each. 

%  OK ARGUMENT and // Summary of the paper: LIT REVIEW // METHODS (1)
Each combination presents different incentives for both brokers and individuals that make them engage in clientelism, either delivering it or accepting it. The argument has three constitutive parts. First, when individuals are highly identifiable, such as when the poor are nested within non-poor areas or when the non-poor are nested within poor areas, brokers will be in a better position to keep those individuals more accountable. Second, when political competition is low there are less incentives to spend too much resources on clientelism, if at all. For example, even when non-poor individuals nested in poor contexts are more identifiable, under low electoral pressures, clientelism is very low. Third, low personal incomes are neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for clientelism. Though higher individual incomes discount faster immediate clientelistic transfers, \emph{in general but not always} poor individuals have more probabilities of receiving it. One of the important propositions of the argument is that clientelism is not channeled to individuals only because of their personal incomes. In fact, non-poor individuals (under certain conditions) receive clientelism too. Consequently, we depart from the canonical (and until recently) (un)challenged finding that only ``the'' poor receive clientelism.

% OK ARGUMENT and // Summary of the paper: LIT REVIEW // METHODS (2)
The four ideal situations in these three contexts are exemplified in \autoref{tab:strategy:set}. Brokers will engage in \emph{individual targeting} in quadrants 1 and 4. As part of what is gained securing each vote is spent in making sure that happens, individual targeting represents a safer investments though its returns are much more limited. Quadrant 1 has higher clientelism than quadrant 4 as poor have higher marginal returns for the same dollar spent in clientelism compared to the non-poor people in quadrant 4. Quadrant 3 represents a situation when politicians are in high need of more electoral support, and when the size of the poor is large, they engage in group-monitoring. Rather than securing each vote individually, brokers take advantage of the spillover effects of clientelism. Finally, quadrant 2 represents a situation where non-poor individuals nested in non-poor areas have a some probability of receiving clientelism. Here brokers engage in group targeting. We theorize that in contexts where there exists less political competition, there also exists less checks and balances too. Even when politicians are not in need of more electoral support, they engage in this expensive form of clientelism which might be understood as embezzlement.


% This paper proceeds as follows
This paper proceeds as follows. First, it reviews classic and newer research on vote buying, particularly paying attention to explanations that, though vaguely, touch upon the distinction between individual and group targeting. We emphasize on the main tensions regarding the lack of clarity on whether which strategy is the most efficient, when and why. Second, it presents the details of the argument. Third, the paper presents the methodology. Exploiting within-municipality variations of individual income in both low and high density contexts in Brazil, and a matched design, the empirical section tests and presents supporting evidence for each of the ideal types. Fourth, the paper offers some final considerations.


\section*{When do parties target individuals and when groups?} 

% OK new papers // PRESENT MAIN THEORIES // (-0)
In both the classic and the newer literatures coexist theories, methodologies, measurement and identification strategies that either focus on only individual \emph{or} group targeting, assuming that both strategies are interchangeable. In fact, most of the times, the distinction is rather product of the method or epistemological tradition. For example, most ethnographers have considered individual targeting (see for example \citet{Scott1972}, \citet{Auyero2000} and \citet{Szwarcberg2013}). While papers employing experimental methods tend to vary, but most accounts focus on individuals aggregated at some level (see for example \citet{Weitz-shapiro} and \citet{Gonzalez-Ocantos2012}). Rather than describing a detailed list of works and their methodologies, the important point is that what has driven the decision to study group-based and/or individual-based targeting strategies (by separate or jointly, as this paper does) has been mostly driven by considerations of research design. Unfortunately, there is no clear theory for why, how and when parties would engage in one or the other. In addition to that, this interchangeability also \emph{implies} that there is no difference between these strategies. As this paper suggests, the structure of incentives each of them provides is something that the literature should address.

% OK new papers // PRESENT MAIN THEORIES - bajada //
The lack of theoretical discussion on whether parties target groups and/or individuals, and when, has produced a tension in the vote-buying literature. This tension is more noticeable when we consider how three standard \emph{contextual} predictors of clientelism (population size, associationism  and political competition) interplay differently when we make the explicit distinction between \emph{individual} and \emph{group} poverty.


% // size (1.1)
\subsection*{Population Size and Coordination Dilemmas}
One of the classic contextual factors has been the size of the community. Group-size has always been an important consideration in social science. Classic political economy literature has longly argued how large groups face more coordination dilemmas (see for example \citet[]{Aldrich}). The main intuition is that if a individual's vote is bought, she may be tempted to accept the benefit and then vote for her preferred candidate. In cases where the size of the community is large, she will hope others will vote for the candidate so the broker continues delivering benefits. Taking this idea as a starting point, several scholars have argued that smaller groups are preferred for brokers because they defect less. For example, \citet[323]{Stokes2005}, \citet[10]{Kitschelt2007} and \citet[p. 67]{Magaloni:2008bq} suggest that the size of population is negatively associated to clientelism. Smaller communities should have higher likelihoods of receiving clientelistic goods since they are easier to monitor. This mechanism, with some modifications, has been readdressed very recently. For the Colombian case, \citet{Rueda2016} argues that clientelism is higher in situations where the electoral results of small groups are available. In Nigeria, for example, \citet[]{Bratton2008a} finds that the strongest predictor of defection is the expectation of others defecting (which is a function of size too). In Brazil too, \citet[p. 456]{Gingerich2013} find that ``vote brokerage thrives in municipalities with very small electorates''. 


% // CRITICIZE size (1.2)
Parties systematically target small-sized communities. Though implied that the literature is referring to individual targeting, it is not clear how political parties derive enough electoral revenues from such a strategy. \citet[]{Brusco2004} and \citet[]{Stokes2005} argue that brokers develop very good skills that even allow them to infer whether individual clients in small-sized communities voted for the party by \emph{looking at them in the eyes}. For the Brazilian case, similar evidence is suggested in \citet{Gay1999,Gay1998}. This strategy implies that local brokers monitor, target, enforce and mobilize electoral support in a one-to-one basis. The theoretical challenge is that this method seems to be extremely expensive given the handful of votes brokers can individually secure. Hence the costs increase linearly with the size of the targeted population, even in low-density population contexts. The broker's production-possibility frontier cannot be shifted upwards either. Monitoring capacities are bounded. Simply put, at some point party machines simply run out of brokers. However, when we distinguish between group-based and individual targeting strategies, brokers can still monitor individuals with some degree of precision in small communities. The important question, however, is what parties do when they face large communities. Do they just stop being clientelistic? Under certain conditions, coordination among individuals nested in very large sized groups is still \emph{very} possible (see \citet{Olson:1965wz}). Hence, this begs the question of \emph{when} and \emph{why} would clientelistic political parties would engage in this costly strategy. And the question for the complementary strategy is still unanswered: Is this strategy exclusive? Does individual targeting in lowly populated areas \emph{prevent} clientelistic political parties targeting highly populated areas? The argument presented here does not argue against this particular strategy. Rather than that, it builds on that idea but explains how and why this strategy is just part of a larger set of strategies. Particularly, this paper presents an argument where parties make use of simultaneous segmented targeting techniques. As the {\color{red} argument section presents}, parties do engage in individual targeting but they rather fix their spendings based on the size of the poor group, individual's personal incomes and the degree in which the incumbent party is electorally contested.

\subsection*{Civic Associations and Organization Buying}

% OK new papers // PRESENT MAIN THEORIES // size and networks (2)
Another important contextual explanatory factor is whether individuals are involved in certain social networks. According to the literature, civic associations might help solving a big portion of the challenges large-sized groups present to brokers. In low-information environments most brokers cannot observe individual electoral behavior. As argued above, brokers might resort to different strategies instead of just stop being clientelistic. Given this impossibility to observe individual's behavior, brokers employ substitutes that allow them to make safer inferences, even in large-sized group contexts, for example by outsourcing monitoring and enforcing to formal and/or informal \emph{networks}. \citet{Schaffer2015} explains that clientelism is ``socially multiplied'', as party machines target individuals ``who are opinion-leading epicenters'' in informal situations. If parties buy turnout (\citet[]{Nichter2008}), they will most probably target associations too, as ``citizens immersed in clientelistic networks [...] have a higher probability of voting than the rest'' (\citet[p. 7]{Carreras2013}). In a similar vein, \citet{Calvo2012} argue that parties target formal ``partisan networks'', in what has been called ``organization buying'' (\citet[p. 250-251]{Stokes:2013cj}). For example, \citet[p. 16]{Holland2015} explains that when ``parties lack their own brokerage networks [they seek] to capitalize on organizational networks instead''. As \citet[]{Rueda2014a} also explains, parties tend to target very specific civic associations\footnote{Particularly, associations of ``seniors and associations of single mothers, organizing trips to recreational centers outside the city where all their expenses are covered'' (p. 13).}. Paradoxically, the stronger the civic society, i.e. the more organized it is, the more clientelism.

% criticize network approach
The positive relationship between group-membership and clientelism is intuitive and appealing. However, what has not been explored yet is whether clientelism is explained by the ``nesting'' or the ``organization buying''  components attached group-membership. Membership into local grass-root associations typically also involve a situation where (typically) poor individuals are nested in contexts of high-poor density. Keeping coordination costs constant, groups typically are formed to address collective problems that otherwise would be much costly to solve by individuals on their own. If that were the case, formal group \emph{membership} should be spuriously related to clientelism. Is clientelism associated to group membership \emph{itself}, or is it associated to the density of the poor that is also present in associations? This paper supports the intuition that there is a positive relationship on clientelism. However, given the identification strategy employed in this paper, we are able to separate the effects of being involved at the local level at different poverty-density nesting levels. Though local involvement does have a positive effect on clientelism, the larger the density of the poor, the higher probability of being targeted. 

\subsection*{Political Competition}
% PRESENT HERE THE political competition ISSUE
In an important paper, \citet[]{Weitz-shapiro} argues that higher levels of political competition in the presence of low socioeconomic levels at the municipal level are positively associated to clientelism in several Argentine municipalities. In the absence of these two, politicians opt-out of clientelism to avoid audience costs. We adopt the same empirical strategy and measure poverty and political competition at the municipal level. Building on that intuition, this paper incorporates individual socio-economic levels and  conceptualize (and empirically model) how different combinations of these three factors change broker's cost/benefit rationale. However, it departs from \citet[]{Weitz-shapiro} in that we exploit the idea of ``costs'' more explicit. In \citet[]{Weitz-shapiro}'s argument, losses are conceptualized in terms of ``moral costs''\footnote{\citet[]{Weitz-shapiro} argues that politicians opt-out of clientelism since non-poor individuals are more likely to condemn clientelism ``due to self-interest or because of \emph{moral} concern[s]'' (emphasis is mine). Self-interest refers to the idea that what is distributed through clientelism is discounted from the pool of resources theoretically available to be spent on policy packages. That \emph{is} an economic cost. Certainly building on that intuition, we incorporate the economic advantages/costs of targeting individuals \emph{or} groups, and when those strategies are efficient and when they are not.}. These type of costs have been theorized in the literature very recently. For example, \citet{Carlin2015} argues that citizens endowed with more democratic values feel more``moral repugnance'' about clientelism. Similarly, \citet{Vicente2014} argues that vote-buying practices have an ``immoral/illegal connotation''. Since clientelism is loaded with unethical associations, \citet{Gonzalez-Ocantos2012} find that individuals usually do not elicit truthful answers when directly asked about clientelism to avoid social stigma. However, it is not clear how individuals who benefit from clientelism really \emph{understand} how this practice harms democracy. Citizens endowed with more democratic values systematically have  higher incomes and better education. In fact \citet{GonzalezOcantos2014} find that while the concrete benefits obtained through clientelism are in general well understood, ``the abstract societal costs of such exchanges are often distant from the every-day world in which clientelistic relationships are formed''. According to their experimental evidence, more educated individuals condemn more, individuals with more exposure to it along with the poor condemn less. 

% concluding paragraph, % purpose of this paper: 
We are left with many questions. There is no consensus on how individual characteristics such as income and macro-structural factors such as the size of the population, the size of the poor group and different levels political competition \emph{interplay together} helping/harming clientelism. It is not clear how both levels of aggregations \emph{shape} broker's incentives to opt for clientelism.  We share \citet{Carlin2015}'s diagnosis, in that ``[e]xisting research looks almost exclusively at individuals' socio-economic and, specially, electoral profile [and] [y]et our knowledge of who parties target remains incomplete''. Hence, more than being an issue about the unit of analyses, we argue that there are very different consequences and explanations for why parties might want to engage in individual or group-based targeting strategies.

\section*{Argument}
 
% Intro
Generalizing the idea that the poor have higher discount rates, we argue that the effects of ``being poor'' and ``living in a poor area'' posit different types of incentives depending on how electorally challenged politicians are. Depending on the incentive structure, brokers are expected to target groups or individuals. These distinctions are novel and improve our understanding of clientelism. In our argument, when certain conditions are met, non-poor individuals do receive clientelism. This might explain why some newer research has not found evidence in support of the most widely accepted predictor in the literature. In addition to that, our research design allow us to observe how both individual income and the density of the poor contribute in different ways to the model.

\subsection*{Individual Targeting}

%% identifiable
Brokers will have incentives to engage in individual targeting when targets are easily \emph{identifiable}. Identifiability helps brokers to keep targeted individuals electorally accountable. Higher levels of identification also reduce the costs of keeping the clientelistic contract enforceable. Whereas individual targeting is the safest bet a broker can make, this mechanism is more expensive as it requires brokers having close relationships with  clients. Party machines know that more resources will need to be allocated to finance dedicated individual targeting for specific individuals. Personalized individual targeting supposes brokers with good-quality local information. Scholars generally agree that the source of information are social networks. For example, \citet[p. 15]{Carlin2015} argues that ``[u]nquestionably, brokers are deeply nested in social networks'', while \citet[p. 864]{Inan2012a} argues that  brokers ``hire respected community leaders in each village to interact with voters to promote their candidacy and offer them money [..] in exchange for the promise of their vote''. Building on this idea, our argument supposes brokers with local knowledge too. However, this knowledge comes from the individual's notoriety rather than his/her ties with local groups. Our identification strategy allows us to investigate this mechanism.


%% political competition
When political competition is low, politicians will have incentives to target identifiable poor individuals nested in low-poor density contexts (quadrant 1 in \autoref{tab:strategy:set}), but when political competition is high, brokers will have incentives to target identifiable non-poor individuals nested in high-poor density contexts (quadrant 4 in \autoref{tab:strategy:set}). As argued before, individual targeting is expensive. Hence, brokers resort to this strategy only when it is necessary. Low political contestation implies a situation where there is no need to invest too much in clientelism. Given that poor individuals have higher discount rates and they are cheaper to buy, they are ideal targets in this context: poor individuals with higher discount rates who are highly identifiable. However, when politicians are heavily contested, brokers have no other choice than spend more resources on clientelism to keep the party in office. \emph{Besides} targeting quadrant 1, they also target identifiable non-poor individuals nested in poor contexts in quadrant 4. Though these clients they are more expensive to buy, engaging in this strategy justifiable to stay the office. Brokers want to stay in quadrant 1, but have no choice than going to quadrant 4 when political competition is high. This paper then generalizes the argument in \citet{Weitz-shapiro}. In this particular context, when political competition is low, party machines do not stop being clientelistic, but engage in individual targeting aiming identifiable individuals with larger discount rates (i.e., poor individuals).

\subsection*{Group Targeting}

% Group Targeting: waiting // introducing potential beneficiaries
Brokers will have incentives to target groups even when individual targets are not identifiable, \emph{if} the socio-economic level of the group provides \emph{spillover} effects. This portion of the argument considers that individuals who are inserted in targeted groups still vote for the broker's party even when they have not received the benefit. For example, \citet[]{Rueda2014a} proposes a formal model which suggests that vote buying is facilitated when voters care about the welfare of other voters. While \citet[p. 65]{Auyero:2000ta} explains the case of \emph{Alfonsina} in Argentina. \emph{Alfonsina} was part of the \emph{broker's inner circle} and got a job as a cleaning lady in a public school. As the broker explained to her before getting the job, \emph{Alfonsina} had to be \emph{patient} because as a member of the circle, she was in the pool of potential beneficiaries. It was only a ``matter of time'' so she could get the job. Building on this intuition, our model presents two ideal types, \emph{actual} and \emph{potential} beneficiaries. The former receive particularistic benefits ``today'' and vote for the broker's candidate ``tomorrow'', while the latter do not receive benefits today (in the expectation of receiving them in the future) but \emph{still} vote for the broker's candidate ``tomorrow''.

% Group Targeting: potential beneficiaries // explanation - expansion
In part, group targeting is possible because potential beneficiaries still vote for the broker's candidate without the benefit (in the hope of being benefited in the short run). Potential beneficiaries have two possible strategies. First, they could defect and vote for another candidate, who might or might not bring them benefits. Second, potential beneficiaries could continue voting for the known broker and wait. Individual income also plays a role. Given that the poor are risk-averse, potential beneficiaries are better-off waiting (and voting for the current broker's party) than defecting. In a slightly different research project, \citet[p. 20]{Magaloni:2008bq} explains that under non-democratic contexts, voters have incentives to keep voting for the incumbent government, \emph{even when they oppose it}. The Mexican PRI lasted so long not because of electoral fraud but because voters supported what it represented the ``known devil''. As she explains, hegemonic parties survive when they are able to sustain long-term economic growth and a constant supply of clientelistic transfers. As of vote-buying, \citet[p. 14]{Zarazaga2014} explains that ``[b]rokers and voters' interests are aligned. The flow of resources to voters is dependent on their brokers' electoral success. If the broker loses the election and is replaced, clients do not know what the new broker will offer them. A new broker may access fewer resources or choose to distribute them to other people; brokers often remind voters about this''. Building on these ideas, we argue that the transaction cost of switching brokers or defecting is very costly since it also involves building confidence relationships with the new broker from scratch. Reputation costs also keep targeted individuals disciplined. Having defected with the former broker once, makes the voter a defection-prone type one, increasing even more the cost of building those relationships. 

% quadrant 3 and 2
When political competition is high, brokers will be in need of securing more electoral support at the lowest price. The cheapest source of electoral support lives in the intersection of low income individuals masked in areas where the density of the poor is high. However, under these circumstances brokers cannot incur in the extremely high costs of engaging in individual targeting. Since individuals are masked within their environments, in these cases identifiability is difficult to get. Rather than that, brokers have economic incentives to target these groups of poor individuals but rely on the spillovers these type of groups provide. For the reasons explained above, when brokers invest in group targeting, the electoral benefits for the broker get multiplied. What is invested in \emph{actual} beneficiaries also makes \emph{potential} beneficiaries to vote for the broker's party. Quadrant 3 in \autoref{tab:strategy:set} depicts such settings. In low-information environments, brokers take advantage of self-enforced compliance mechanisms. Turning into quadrant 2, non-poor individuals nested in non-poor groups are also difficult to identify. However, given that non-poor individuals give less value to the same dollar invested in clientelism than poor individuals, brokers will target these groups only when brokers have less electoral pressures (low political competition). In this setting, elected members have more room to move, and hence embezzlement (as a way of expensive clientelism) is more likely. In these cases, clientelism has the lowest levels.

\section*{Case Selection, Data and Design}

% explain the identification strategy, introducing Brazil as the case
The unit of analysis is individuals. Particularly, we are interested in testing the effects of individuals with different income levels being nested in communities with different poverty sizes at different levels of political competition on receiving clientelism. We find Brazil to be a good case, and so we use survey data from 2010 from \citet{LAPOP2010}\footnote{``I thank the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) and its major supporters (the United States Agency for International Development, the United Nations Development Program, the Inter-American Development Bank, and Vanderbilt University) for making the data available''. The sample consists of five strata representing the five main geographical regions of Brazil. Each stratum was further sub-stratified by urban and rural areas.} to tests this idea. Brazil constitutes a good case as its poverty structure allows having poor individuals nested in non-poor areas (and vice versa). Simply put, low income levels do not properly classify individuals into high-poverty density contexts (and vice versa). To ensure this assumption holds, the data was preprocessed using a matching algorithm which is explained below. In this case, the advantage of this method is that, based on observables, the systematic relationship between income and the density of the poor is forced to be zero (\citet{King2011}). \autoref{fig:municipality:wealth:large:plot} in the Appendix shows that the raw dataset have already embedded into them low levels of correlation (\Sexpr{round(cor(dat$wagehalf, dat$wealth), 2)}), while the matched dataset have even lower levels (\Sexpr{round(cor(m.data$wagehalf, m.data$wealth), 2)}).

\subsection*{Density of the Poor, Political Competition and Income}

% Density of the Poor
To measure the size of the poor, we follow a similar strategy presented in \citet{Weitz-shapiro}, measuring the degree of poverty at the municipal level. Using information from the 2010 Brazilian census\footnote{Official data comes from the Bureau of Statistics of Brazil \href{http://www.ibge.gov.br}{IBGE}.}, a variable that measures the percentage of individuals who live with less than half of the minimum wage was constructed. Given that we observe the municipality of residence for each individual interviewed by LAPOP, we were able to triangulate that percentage for each individual. Although this percentage was originally a semi-continuous variable, it had to be dichotomized at the median to be able to construct the matched (\Sexpr{round(as.numeric(median(m.data$wagehalf)), 2)}\%). There have been theoretical advances regarding general treatment effects regimes for continuous or semi-continuous response doses (\citet{Ratkovic2012}, \citet{Hirano2004}), algorithms capable to match on continuous treatment variables are not common. \autoref{fig:tgraph:plot} shows the continuous distribution dichotomized at the median (dashed line). However, we still provide alternative models using the original continuous variable as a robustness, matching on the generalized propensity score. In these cases, the \texttt{GPS} is used as a weighting regressor not as a matching device (see \citet{Imbens2004}, \citet{Guardabascio2014} and \citet[]{Imai2014b}). The advantage of this strategy is that it does not require dichotomization.

% Matching
To break further systematic relationships between group poverty and other important confounding factors, the size of the community proxied by an urban/rural variable was also included in the matching procedure along with municipal opposition and individual involvement in civic associations. This strategy sought to break any systematic relationships between the size of the poor and these variables by balancing the distribution of these variables via a deleting procedure\footnote{The final procedure matched \Sexpr{as.numeric(as.data.frame(sum.match[2])[2,1])} individuals living in the low-density condition with \Sexpr{as.numeric(as.data.frame(sum.match[2])[2,2])} individuals living in the high-density condition.}. A good overall-balance\footnote{See \autoref{fig:balance:distance:plot} in the Appendix.} and covariate balance were obtained (see \autoref{fig:balance:plot}). From a statistical standpoint, preprocessed datasets are less model-dependent (\citet{Ho2006}) and prevent analysts making extreme counterfactuals (\citet{King2005a}). The matching routine used was the ``coarsen exact matching'' \texttt{CEM} which is a class of exact matching (\citet{King2015b})\footnote{``The basic idea of CEM is to coarsen each variable by recoding so that substantively indistinguishable values are grouped and assigned the same numerical value (groups may be the same size or different sizes depending on the substance of the problem). Then, the ``exact matching'' algorithm is applied to the coarsened data to determine the matches and to prune unmatched units. Finally, the coarsened data are discarded and the original (uncoarsened) values of the matched data are retained'' (\citet[p. 8]{Iacus2011}). ``Automated coarsening'' was used (\citet[p. 7]{Iacus2009a}).}. \autoref{tab:sum:stats:r} and \autoref{tab:sum:stats:m} provide summary statistics for both the matched and raw datasets {\color{red}PENDING}. Both the preprocessed and raw datasets have \Sexpr{length(levels(m.data$municipality))} municipalities. \autoref{fig:municipality:income:large:plot:matched} shows the municipalities and which ones are considered as ``high'' or ``low'' in terms of the density of the poor. The figure also shows that there exists  considerable variance regarding income in both high and low poverty density conditions\footnote{\autoref{municipality:sample:plot} shows the distribution of observations by municipalities, by income levels in both raw and matches datasets.}.

% Political Competition // Income
To measure political competition, the paper follows the advice of \citet[]{Weitz-shapiro}. Official electoral data for the 2008 municipal elections were collected\footnote{\href{http://agencia.tse.jus.br/estatistica/sead/odsele/votacao_candidato_munzona/votacao_candidato_munzona_2008.zip}{Tribunal Superior Eleitoral}.}. This variable measures the percentage of seats that are \emph{not} controlled by the mayor's party in a given municipal council. People who are somewhat better off than their neighbors but live in poor areas may not ``feel'' poor. If this is the case, this could confound the results\footnote{I thank the reviewers of LAPS for this suggestion.}. Also, when answering the questioner, individuals might not want to reveal their true incomes (either because it is too low or too high). Following the advice of \citet{Cordova2008,Cordova2009,Cordova2010}, a relative wealth index (RWI) was constructed. Using principal component analyses, the index measures wealth based on actual assets weighted by how common those assets are. Different indexes were constructed for urban and rural contexts.


\subsection*{Outcome Variable}

Clientelism was measured using the question that asks if \emph{a candidate or someone from a political party offered [the individual] something, like a favor, food, or any other benefit or thing in return for [her/his] vote or support?} Subjects could answer whether this had happened \emph{often}, \emph{sometimes} or \emph{never}. \citet[614]{Carreras2013a} and \citet[]{Holland2015} use the same dataset and outcome variable. As they explain, the question did not ask if respondents took the offer, hence it should not be an important source of bias. The alternatives \emph{often} (\Sexpr{as.numeric(table(m.data$clientelism)["Often"])}) and \emph{sometimes} (\Sexpr{as.numeric(table(m.data$clientelism)["Sometimes"])}) were collapsed into one to have a dichotomous response variable.


\subsection*{Control Variables}

% HERE

% Why I included the control variables I included
Following the advice of \citet{Ho2006}, the same set of covariates in \autoref{eq:1} were included in the parametric stage. \emph{Perception of Corruption} was included so as to keep constant the effect of respondents who declared clientelistic activity when in reality they were referring to corruption scandals. \citet[]{Rueda2014a,Holland2015,Carreras2013} argue that group association is related to clientelism. These associations allow for bloc-turnout and lower defection rates (\citet[]{Stokes:2013cj}). Following \citet[p. 28]{Holland2015}, who use the same dataset/year, an additive index to measure civic participation (here called ``political involvement'') was created \footnote{Attendance frequency to religious organizations, meetings of a community improvement committee and meetings of a political party/organization, with variables \texttt{cp6}, \texttt{cp8} and \texttt{cp13} in the LAPOP dataset, respectively.}. Group size has also been claimed to be important (\citet[]{Stokes2005,Kitschelt2007}). Smaller communities are easier to be monitored, and also represent a safer bet for brokers (\citet[]{Rueda2014a}). Following their strategy, a dummy for \emph{urban} was included. In a similar vein, \citet[]{Rueda2014a} interacts population size at the municipal level with a variable that captures ``political involvement''. To account for that, census data (from 2010), particularly population size at the municipal level was collected and interacted with ``political involvement''\footnote{I use \citet[]{Holland2015}'s strategy again.} (model 5, \autoref{tab:1}). Finally, both terms were interacted (model 6, \autoref{tab:1}). Lastly, building upon some of the distributive politics literature, following particularly \citet{Stokes2005}, \citet{Dixit:1996wp} and \citet{Nichter2008}, a variable that captures party identification (\emph{Political Id}) was included. The idea is to see whether machines target supporters or not.



\subsection*{Estimation Method}

{\color{red}SAY I USED GEE see Hanley2003a}

It is important to stress that this identification strategy is not about municipalities. That would mean to incur in ecological fallacy. What the treatment variable captures is a characteristic that every individual shares with his/her environment. Hence, the variable reflects features of the average individual at a micro-level. 

As clientelism can only take two values, 1 when clientelism occurs and 0 otherwise, it needs to be estimated using a logistic regression. However, as \autoref{fig:clien2r} shows, clientelism is a rare event. For this reason this variable is estimated via a rare event logistic regression which corrects problems due to rare events (\citet{King2001a}, \citet{King:2001wo})\footnote{We report different estimation methods as well in the \hyperref[robcheck]{Robustness Checks}.}. 

\subsection*{Results} 



\autoref{tab:1} shows the estimations\footnote{The main model in this paper, is Model 4 in \autoref{tab:1}. All robustness checks, scatter plots and extra statistical evidence replicate this model. When the standard errors are clustered by municipality or when fixed-effects are included, the results reveal the same substantive effects for most of the models.}. \emph{High density} is positive, statistically significant and robust across all specifications. As expected, \emph{income} is negative, but very weak and non-significant. In substantive terms, these findings strongly suggest that what drives machines to target clientelism is the socioeconomic level of groups, irrespective of individual levels of income. In other words, a poor individual that lives where the density of the poor is low has less chances of receiving clientelistic goods compared to an \emph{equally} poor individual who lives where the density of the poor is high. The \emph{political involvement index} is positive but non-significant. Population size and the interaction term proposed in \citet[]{Weitz-shapiro}\footnote{Implementing what \citet[]{Armstrong:2010jk} suggests, \autoref{fig:weitz:1} corroborates the results in \autoref{tab:1}.} do not seem to have an impact both effects are almost indistinguishable from zero and also non-significant.

\subsection*{The Density of the Poor}


% The treatment variable works and it is very strong.
\autoref{tab:1} strongly suggests that controlling for everything else, including group membership, individual income and population size, individuals who live in poverty clusters have a higher probability of being bribed. \autoref{fig:fig:4} shows a probability density plot. Following \citet[]{King2000}, after the main model was estimated, the parameters were simulated 2,500 times in order to build more stable estimates. The plot strongly suggests that someone living in a highly-poor dense area has twice the chances of being bribed than someone living in an area where the density of the poor is low NUMBER HERE, keeping individual income levels balanced in both groups.



\subsection*{Is Associationism Associated to Clientelism?}


% On the issue of 
New research argues that associations at the local level are strongly associated with clientelism. For example, \citet[]{Rueda2014a} interacts population size with group membership. The argument is that small groups would represent a less risky investment for the broker, while associations would provide a much more effective and cheaper aggregated monitoring. However, given the nature of clientelism, most empirical models deal with binary response variables. Consequently, interaction terms within the limited dependent variables are complicated. ``The magnitude of the interaction effect in nonlinear models does not equal the marginal effect of the interaction term, can be of opposite sign, and its statistical significance is not [usually] calculated by standard softwares'' (\citet[]{Ai2003}). Due to cross-partial derivatives are not an alternative either, simulation methods are required to estimate the combined effects of the interaction term (\citet[]{WilliamJ.Wales2013}). 

% The plot shows a non existent relationship.
Repeating the process described above on simulations,  \autoref{fig:int:1} takes the estimates of model 5 in \autoref{fig:int:1} and plots 600 simulated expected probabilities for each level of political involvement on the probability of clientelism. The figure shows an interaction between the log of population and the political involvement index (see \citet[]{Holland2015,Rueda2014a}), particularly, going from the minimum (red) to the maximum (blue) population (in log scale). On the one hand, the estimates of model 5 in \autoref{tab:1} are consistent with the theory. The estimate is (weakly) negative and non significant. More importantly, \autoref{fig:int:1} suggests that once this interaction term is decomposed by changes in population size for different values of political involvement, there is no strong evidence to suggest that small-sized population (in red) have higher probabilities of clientelism compared to big-sized population municipalities (in blue). In other words, both groups do not seem to be classified by their membership in different population sizes.


% Associationism and Size of the Poor as confounded factors
Results regarding population size and associationism are not consistent with past research. Aside from that, another aspect that needs attention is the relationship between the size of the poor and associationism. As argued before, new research on clientelism finds that there is an association between group membership and clientelism. However, in theory, it would be reasonable to expect that poor individuals join associations at the local level to solve their problems. Keeping coordination costs constant, groups typically are formed to address collectively problems that otherwise would be much costly to solve by individuals on their own\footnote{{\color{red}DO WE NEED TO SUPPORT THIS VERY INTUITIVE OBSERVATION?}}. If that were the case, high-poor density ought to be confounded with group membership. However, we still do not know whether brokers target individuals \emph{because they are related to an association} (standard finding in the literature so far) or \emph{because brokers target their resources to highly populated poor groups} (this paper's argument). 

% Comments on the plot
Using the estimates from the main model,  \autoref{fig:int:2} plots simulated expected probabilities of clientelism by different values of political involvement. Conveniently, it decomposes this relationship by high-poverty density (blue) and low poverty density (red). The plot \emph{strongly} suggests that, controlling for everything else, as \emph{political involvement} increases, \emph{in general}, clientelism has a higher probability. \emph{However}, once we decompose this probability by high and low poverty densities, it is very clear that what really drives the general upward trend is the highly-dense poverty context, \emph{not political involvement itself}. These findings might explain why other papers have found (statistical) evidence in favor of group membership and associationism. It seems safe to suggest that what mainly explains clientelism is not membership into associations \emph{per se}, but \emph{the aggregated economic composition of the group}. 

\subsection*{Robustness Checks\label{robcheck}}



Additionally, due that clientelism generate mostly zeros, a zero-inflated Poisson regression was considered (see \citet{Long:1997wv}). This specification assumes that the process that inflates the zeros (not shown) is driven by \emph{income} and \emph{high density}\footnote{\emph{Income} was excluded from the non-zero specification because of multicollinearity.}. The treatment variable behaves very well regardless of the assumed functional form. \autoref{gps:tab} shows the same models run in \autoref{tab:1} but using a 


The substantive results are the same. After implementing what \citet[]{Fong2015} suggest, \autoref{fig:gps:fig} consistently shows that as the density of the poor increases, the probability of clientelism increases considerably. 

Lastly, \autoref{tab:sens} shows evidence about bias reduction (or increase) using the $\mathcal{L}$ statistic test for imbalance (\citet[]{Iacus2011}). When $\mathcal{L}=1$ there is perfect imbalance, while when $\mathcal{L}=0$ there is perfect balance. In substantive terms, perfect balance means that covariates are identical under the treatment and control conditions. Moreover, when the data is perfectly balanced, the treatment assignment mechanism is ignorable. The table also shows the difference in means given a switch from control to treatment conditions. The matched set seems to have a very good balance\footnote{Matching breaks the systematic bias between the treatment variable (the density of the poor) and the rest of the covariates. It does \emph{not} break the systematic relationship respect to the outcome variable, i.e. clientelism. Hence statistical significance is still possible between income and clientelism as this relationship is not zeroed by matching methods.}. 


\subsection*{Discussion: Potential and Actual Beneficiaries}

All and all, group membership itself does not seem to be associated to clientelism. Individual income does not seem to be a strong predictor of clientelism either. A similar conclusion applies for other arguments related to population size and other interactions. This paper proposed that there is a much more flexible way brokers can effectively target their resources. Brokers take advantage of the aggregated economic structure of the communities they target. This structure impose very clear incentives to the bribed: \emph{actual} beneficiaries want to keep benefits coming, while \emph{potential} beneficiaries are better off waiting their turn. Brokers take advantage of the spillover effects associated to the territorial proximity of poor individuals. This argument does not need brokers to know bribed's vote intention, nor it does require bribed to be involved in formal associations, nor it depends on the size of population. What really binds individuals is the aggregated poverty structure. This model argued that aggregated poverty is what makes individuals living in high-poor dense areas to act coordinately. In order to improve their economic situation, all of them have enough incentives to vote for the broker's candidate. To conclude, \emph{Is this an ``AND'' or an ``OR'' story?} It might be the case that clientelism based on individual income might be a complementary strategy with the group-poverty strategy. The empirical results presented here seem to strongly support the latter, exclusively. However, all empirical models and quantitative analyses are well suited to study the average case. The data analyzed here suggest that a poor individual that lives where the density of the poor is low has less chances of receiving clientelistic goods compared to an equally poor individual who lives where the density of the poor is high.

EDITORS COMMENTS:

- The locational dimension seems to be the manuscript’s core theoretical dimension, so it should be the key to framing the theoretical contribution.
- the mechanisms for locational targeting are underdone.
- what targeting is and how it is done: USE Szwarcberg and Weitz-Shapiro.
-  Reader #4 (effectiveness of clientelism): Your study can add something to the emerging literature our colleague cites that points to some of the limitations of clientelist politics.

# this is a paper about vote buying

# contexts that are clientelism-inducing


# effectiveness gap”  between clientelistic effort and payoff in Latin American regimes (Kitschelt and Altamirano 2015), subnational data indicating that clientelistic parties often shy away from such under-the-table tactics in certain constituencies (Weitz-Shapiro 2014), and micro level findings suggesting that some citizens are fundamentally against, or at least unaffected by, clientelistic strategies (Carlin and Moseley 2015; Imai, Park, and Green 2014; Ocantos et al. 2013; Vicente 2014). Yet the author(s) continues to make strong claims for the effectiveness of clientelism throughout. First, this probably isn’t appropriate given that the analysis presented here says nothing about the effectiveness of vote buying, per se.  wonder how this paper fits into a larger narrative about the failure of clientelism in 21st century Latin America?

# dont say the poor live sorrounded by more poor // say that in high density --> spillovers are more effective since (1) there more poor, (2) less middle income / rich folks (in line with Shapiro). // Related to this: Is this simply a matter of maximizing finite resources, and parties willingly accept certain inefficiencies at the micro level when targeting clusters of poor people, given the difficulties of targeting at the individual level? (from reviewer 4).



# Why I excluded constitutive terms of the interaction terms:
## Brambor2005: 72. ``he coefficient on the constitutive term X must not be interpreted as the average effect of a change in X on Y as it can in a linear-additive regression model. As the above discussion should have made clear, the coefficient on X only captures the effect of X on Y when Z is zero. [SEE HERE] Similarly, it should be obvious that the coefficient on Z only captures the effect of Z on Y when X is zero.9 It is, therefore, incorrect to say that a positive and significant coefficient on X (or Z) indicates that an increase in X (or Z) is expected to lead to an increase in Y'' This indicates why either SIZE OF THE POOR as a constitutive term AND ANU OTHER CONSTITUTIVE TERM cannot be interpreted alone.

## Brambor2005: 76 ``often impossible to evaluate conditional hypotheses using only the information provided in traditional results tables''

## Brambor2005:74 The analyst cannot even infer whether X has a meaningful conditional effect on Y from
the magnitude and significance of the coefficient on the interaction term either.12 As we showed earlier, it is perfectly possible for the marginal effect of X on Y to be significant for substantively relevant values of the modifying variable Z even if the coefficient on the interaction term is insignificant. Note what this means. It means that one cannot determine whether a model should include an interaction term simply by looking at the significance of the coefficient on the interaction term. Numerous articles ignore this point and drop interaction terms if this coefficient is insignificant

# My argument
	## 


	
		
		
	## Against Rueda:  
		### ``Only when results of small groups are available do voters feel that their vote can be important in reaching any number of votes that the broker considers acceptable to deliver future rewards.'' // 
		### ``It is also important to highlight that the proposed mechanism predicts a negative effect of higher aggregation of electoral results on vote buying irrespective of the overall size of the electorate or the size of the population. Even in large electorates, it is still possible to sustain vote buying transactions if a group of brokers within that large electorate has access to electoral results of small groups of voters''
		### ``collective monitoring''. // In line with (Stokes 2005; Stokes et al. 2013): 
		### ``The article offers the first systematic empirical assessment of the use of collective monitoring and highlights a theory that clarifies why small groups’ results facilitate these transactions even when the voting behavior of those bribed is not observed.'' I SAY `COLLECTIVE MONITORING` IS MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN THE DENSITY OF THE POOR IS LARGE, WHY? BC OF SPILLOVER EFFECTS. BROKERS DON'T NEED TO OBSERVE, THEY JUST NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SPILLOVER EFFECTS.
		### ``Since their choices are not likely to determine whether the termination of future bribes will occur, the bribed voters would have a greater incentive to vote according to their true preferences.'' THIS IS TRUE. HOWEVER, THEIR CHOICES WILL ENDANGER THE CREDIBILITY THE COMMUNITY HAS. THAT ESSENTIALLY COMPROMISES THE POSSIBILITY OF RECEIVING INDUCEMENTS.


		### WHy do I say this is not right? Essentially, 
	## Against Rueda: ``There should be more vote buying incidents where fewer voters vote at each polling station''.
	## Income has not explained the results well in the clientelism literature. That is why this paper proposes a mechanism where this economic factor is complexed. 
		(1) non-poor individuals do receive clientelistic offerings, i.e. when the size of the poor is small and when competition is low. In these cases, there exists a situation where parties are not systematically challenged, and supported elections after elections, reinforcing their hegemonic power. Low poverty density contexts imply an environment where the middle class and higher-income individuals are the majority. This increases the marginal costs of clientelism, but given the lack of checks and balances, and the larger discretionality non-challenged parties have, they can easily afford more expensive clients. Lets remember that political competition is measured by the proportion of seats that are different than the major's party. As Szwarcberg2013:39-40 argues, ``Access to resources is, however, conditioned by the level of government - national, provincial, or municipal''.
		#### Behavior of latent and actual beneficiaries is the same when the size of the poor is large.

# Vote-Buying Paper
	## Rueda2016 ``vote buying separates it from other forms of clientelism in which rewards are given to groups whose voting behavior is known'' .
	## Definition of vote-buying: ``the proffering to voters of cash or (more commonly) minor consumption goods by political parties, in office or in opposition, in exchange for the recipient’s vote''. (Brusco, Nazareno, and Stokes 2004, 67)

# Effectiveness Gap

  ## ``Latin American countries exhibit a striking ``effectiveness gap'' in that politicians make great efforts to target voters with clientelistic goods, but fail to generate a commensurate number of votes with these practices'' (p. 247).
  ## ``The dominant argument about the incidence of clientelism in partisan politics has to do with economic development. Poor people laboring at the bare subsistence threshold are expected to discount the future and prefer an immediate, tangible personal direct gain of clientelistic inducement compared to a distance, less tangible collective indirect policy gain. Conversely, as citizen's income rises, the material inducements of clientelism become of questionable value'' (p. 254).
  	### This is an explanation about ``clientelistic effort''. What if ``the density of the poor'' decreases the amount of effort needed to be clientelism an effective strategy? This should also be mediated by the degree of competition.
  ## ``High competitiveness forces politicians to deploy their resources in the best possible manner [...] high competitiveness will always make politicians engage in clientelistic targeting if they are fairly certain that is effective'' (p. 261). ``\emph{Hence, greater competitiveness should unconditionally reduce the gap between clientelistic effort and clientelistic effectiveness, whether the equilibrium is a hight or a low level of clientelistic effort}.'' (p. 261)
  ## ``parties' capacity to mobilize and monitor voters (e.g., via social/civic/party networks) will increase clientelistic effectiveness''
  ## ``Similar to other developing democracies, Colombia’s electoral environment is such that brokers have a hard time identifying the preferred candidates or voting proclivities of individuals.'' (Rueda2016:5	)
  ## ``Their electoral profiles are composed of behaviors that are difficult to monitor with certainty and attitudes''. This quote from Carlin2015: 15.
  ## ``Hence, brokers must draw inferences about future behavior from information about fluid attitudes and past electoral behavior. But since that information is often imperfect or incomplete, brokers' predictions are imprecise'' .

# Section on Brazilian politics.
 ## ``Brazil has served as a poster-child for the impact of electoral rules on clientelism. The interaction of multimember districts with voting on open lists and the absence of vote-pooling of candidate preference votes under the auspices of the same list, as well as the \emph{candidato nato} rule that removed parties' control over the nominations process and let an electoral legislator to decide to run on any party ticket, clearly made Brazil one of the most personalistic systems of democratic governance''. (Latin American Voter, p. ?).
 ## %INCLUDE THIS CITATION: \citet[]{Gingerich2014b}:.
 ## # Why not so much emphasis on Brazilian politics. : ``The theoretical mechanism highlighted here is not directly tied to the idiosyncrasies of the Colombian democratic experience''



 # My argument
 	## Work that links micro and macro explanations of clientelism. Particularly, how macro poverty levels change the incentives of politicians to engage in clientelism at the micro level.

 %\citet[]{Zarazaga2014}:``While monitoring and reciprocity may exist, they are not the main mechanisms that enforce voters' compliance with clientelistic deals. None of the brokers I interviewed thought it possible to check how an individual voted. Even brokers who admitted to cheating on election day denied this possibility. Although 22 brokers acknowledged that they stole other party ballots from the polling stations, and 12 even admitted to paying certain clients with illegal drugs, none of them reported monitoring individual votes. Furthermore, voters' and brokers' narratives show that we cannot disregard the rationality of the actors involved.'' (p. 38). ``Voters prefer to keep dealing with brokers who have fulfilled their promises, because past deliveries prove that those brokers are not smoke merchants. Once voters have seen that a broker can deliver, they will support that broker; they choose to do so because they know that they can rely on that broker to deliver more goods in the future'' (p. 38-39). ``Brokers and voters' interests are aligned. The flow of resources to voters is dependent on their brokers' electoral success. If the broker loses the election and is replaced, clients do not know what the new broker will offer them. A new broker may access fewer resources or choose to distribute them to other people; brokers often remind voters about this. I witnessed firsthand, for example, how a broker, on the eve of Election Day 2009, gave a food handout to an elderly person while reminding her, ``if we lose there might not be any more food handouts'''' (p. 39). ``Voters with good brokers have strong incentives to keep their brokers; knowing that their brokers will keep their position as long as they are successful at the voting booth, voters will protect their own interest by voting for the brokers' candidates.'' (p. 39)

CRITICIZE THAT!


% What others have considered is incomplete: organization buying doesn't really apply (0)
%The ``network'' effects of clientelism have been considered before. For example, \citet[p. 250-251]{Stokes:2013cj} present the concept of ``organization buying'', where ``voters do not sell their vote but their involvement in their broker's networks''. If party machines need to buy turnout (\citet[]{Nichter2008}), they will most probably target associations too, as ``citizens immersed in clientelistic networks [...] have a higher probability of voting than the rest'' (\citet[p. 7]{Carreras2013}). \citet[p. 16]{Holland2015} explains that when ``parties lack their own brokerage networks [they seek] to capitalize on organizational networks instead''. For example, ``In Colombia, parties buy the votes of associations of seniors and associations of single mothers, organizing trips to recreational centers outside the city where all their expenses are covered'' (\citet[p. 13]{Rueda2014a}). If this were the case, associationism, i.e. formal ties to local networks, would be paradoxically reversing the quality of the democracy in clientelistic societies.



%\citet[]{Gingerich2013}: how uncertainty about electoral outcomes grows with the size of a jurisdiction, and how risk adverse brokers might prefer to avoid such uncertainty. the existence of brokerage depends on the size of the electorate contained within the jurisdiction controlled by the broker, with large jurisdiction sizes tending to drive brokerage out of existence. In BRazil: vote brokerage thrives in municipalities with very small elec- torates and tends to diminish precipitously as the size of the electorate expands. in many low information environments vote brokers are the only agents with the local knowledge and power necessary to make clientelistic redistribution a viable proposition for a polity’s major political actors. brokers make explicit recommendations to voters about candidates, knowing full well that they will mon- itor compliance at the jurisdictional-level and not at the individual-level. Third, the electoral success of the recommended candidate brings with it substantial collective benefits to the jurisdiction (mediated, of course, by the broker) as well as considerable personal benefits to the broker himself. STRATEGY: ln(registered.voters) is main IV.



\citet[]{Rueda2014a} {\bf The analysis that follows does not rely on reciprocity}: (1) broker sustains bribed voters' compliance by conditioning future bribes on whether her candidate's votes reach an optimally set threshold: In the model, the broker optimally sets a threshold of votes for her candidate. If the threshold is not reached in a particular polling station, those who were bribed are excluded from future payments for a fixed number of periods. (2) model does not require brokers to observe individual voters' political preferences or even vote totals of the bribed voters. I show that when there is uncertainty about voters' preferences, compliance can be sustained as long as electoral results of small groups are available. (3) vote buying is facilitated when voters care about the welfare of other voters. NOTE THIS DIFFERENCE: {\bf However, repeated interactions by themselves cannot solve the commitment problem faced by bribed voters when future benefits are determined by aggregate election results}. A voter who receives the broker's payment could vote for her preferred candidate while hoping that other bribed voters would comply with their part of the deal. In this case, the voters' commitment problem is compounded by a collective action problem. All bribed voters who oppose the buyer's candidate have incentives to free-ride on others' compliance while voting for their preferred choices. A major difference with previous models that use repeated interactions to sustain vote buying, like the ones in Stokes (2005) and Gallego (2012), is that this paper's model allows us to explore in detail the bribed voters' collective action problem. after the first election the broker continues distributing bribes to the same voters in normal periods and she does not distribute bribes during punishment ones. {\bf As for the broker's utility, it increases with the number of votes her candidate receives, and with the money that was not spent buying votes. THIS MEANS THAT AS THE SIZE OF THE TARGETED POPULATION INCRWASES, THE UTILITY BECOMES MORE RISKY: ``Then higher levels of aggregation represent a big obstacle for vote buying as the next result shows'' (p. 9)}. Punishments are necessary since the voters would not be able to believe that once low results were realized and there were no subsequent consequences, things would be any different in the future. expectations about others' actions: people tend not to comply when they think that others are doing the same. If 80\% or more of the potential opponents among those that were bribed are expected to comply, then it is better for a particular bribed opponent to do so as well.
